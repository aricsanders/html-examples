            <!-- This makes the line a hyperlink. Inside of the SVG you have to give the hyperlink a namespace so it knows
            that you did not make up another tag with attribute href. This is why inside of the svg tag you need to

        L100,100 is Line to 100,100. The syntax for curves and arcs gets a little more involved see

        the css and internal hyperlinks will not work. -->

    <!-- Now for the plot. In the source you only have this lowly div tag, but when the javascript at the end of the page
    gets run it replaces the div tag with an svg. The javascript at the end of the page uses the functions and classes
    defined by the <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script> tag in the head.
    You can see the resulting svg by using inspect element on your
    browser usually F12 or right click-->
    <h1>The plotly plot</h1>
    <div id="myDiv" style="width: 480px; height: 400px;"><!-- Plotly chart will be drawn inside this DIV --></div>


    <!-- Now for the latex. When the script tag
    <script type="text/javascript" async  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script>
    runs, it looks through the source, after the rest of the page is loaded, looking for any $$. If it finds them
    it assumes it is Latex. see https://www.mathjax.org/ just because 3 syntaxes were not enough. Note there is
    an order if you do both plotly and mathjax, plotly must come before mathjax in the head section to work.
    -->
    <h1>The Mathjax latex</h1>
    <p>
    When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
    $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

    <!-- By tradition, scripts in the body are usually put at the very bottom so that the page loads
        and then the scripts run. Inside the script tag we change our syntax to JavaScript -->

    <script>
    // We define a variable that is a class in JavaScript,
    // that has pretty much the same form as a dictionary in Python.
    // Unlike CSS, we have both line and block comments.
    var trace1 = {
    x: [1, 2, 3, 4],
    y: [10, 15, 13, 17],
    type: 'scatter'
     };
    // This format is dictated by the plotly.js library see https://plot.ly/
    // There are a bunch of javascript plotting libraries I just choose plotly because it had a cdn and a python counterpart
    var trace2 = {
    x: [1, 2, 3, 4],
    y: [16, 5, 11, 9],
    type: 'scatter'
    };
    // data is a list or array of traces
    var data = [trace1, trace2];

    // This class method lives someplace in the plotly-latest.min.js it
    // uses the id on my div to replace it with the plot
    Plotly.newPlot('myDiv', data);
